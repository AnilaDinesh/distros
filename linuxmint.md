# Linux Mint

Linux Mint is a community-driven Linux distribution based on Debian and Ubuntu that strives to be a "modern, elegant and comfortable operating system which is both powerful and easy to use."

Linux Mint provides full out-of-the-box multimedia support by including some proprietary software and comes bundled with a variety of free and open-source applications.

Linux Mint is a stable, robust, and elegant Ubuntu-based distribution.

Linux Mint is a great ‘default’ distro for new Linux users, as it comes with a lot of the software you’ll need when switching from Mac or Windows, such as LibreOffice, the favoured productivity suite of Linux users. It also has better support for proprietary media formats, allowing you to play videos, DVDs and MP3 music files out of the box.

A strong option for those new to Linux

>Impressive amount of customisation options

>Good media support out of the box

>Ideal for those switching from Windows/Mac

Releases are timed to be approximately one month after Ubuntu releases (which in turn are about one month after Gnome releases and two months after X Window System releases). Consequently, every Linux Mint release comes with an updated version of both GNOME and X and features some of the improvements brought in the latest Ubuntu release. Support for most releases is discontinued two months after the next release, but since the mid-2008 v5 every fourth release has been labelled a long-term support (LTS) version, indicating that it is supported (with updates) for longer, three years for v5 and v9, and five years thereafter.

Linux Mint 17 "Qiana" LTS was released on 31 May 2014, remaining current until the end of November 2014 and supported until April 2019. In mid-2014 the successor to 17 Qiana was announced to be 17.1 Rebecca; the development team said that from a technical point of view Linux Mint was no longer tied to the Ubuntu schedule, so it could be released at any time, although the six-month cycle provided rhythm, leading to a late November 2014 target. Linux Mint 17 LTS would be the first release of the 17.x series, and for two years applications would be backported to 17.x, with security updates until 2019.

The latest release is Linux Mint 19 "Tara", released on 29 June 2018. As an LTS release, it will be supported until 2023, and it is planned that future versions until 2020 will use the same package base, making upgrades easy.
